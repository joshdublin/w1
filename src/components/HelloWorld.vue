<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>One of the monumental technological shifts in my lifetime is the introduction of touchscreen devices or smartphones. I was born in 1996, and the original iPhone came out in 2007. However, it wasn’t until about 2011 that I noticed most of my peers had them, and I didn’t get one myself until I was 15. Nowadays, children are addicted to smart devices like the iPhone. This is the world they grew up in and they will never know a world without smart technology. I feel smartphones take away from the fun of childhood.   </p>
<p>Prior to the iPhone, websites were very popular, but most people just used the internet while on the computer. Suddenly, many people were accessing the internet through their mobile devices. Many people were now using apps that connected to the internet.</p>
<p>Smartphones have always been an important issue to me, so I have chosen this as my research topic.</p>
<h1>
    How did the invention of the iPhone and other smartphones affect society?
    </h1>
<p>The smartphone allows us for increased connectivity, improved access to information, enhanced productivity, and greater convenience. On the other hand, smartphones have negative effects such as addiction, social isolation, sleep disruption, and distraction while driving [1].</p>
<p>Smartphones have germs, they can inure your neck, texting while driving is dangerous, talking on the phone while driving is dangerous, the light from the phone can be dangerous, it can affect sleep, and it can cause lapses in attention while walking which can cause injury. Smartphones could even cause cancer [2]. </p>
<p>Kids who get smartphones earlier can become adults with worse mental health. </p>
<p>“At the After Babel Substack, we have argued that the sudden switch of teen social life from flip phones (which are designed for communication) to smartphones (which enabled continuous access to social media and much higher levels of phone addiction), is the major cause, though not the only one. There are unique factors at work in each country, but we know of no alternative that can explain the synchronized, gendered, and global decline in teen mental health” [3].</p>
<p>It is alarming that smartphones are directly linked to a decline in mental health globally. We may think that this would be enough for society to decide to stop using smartphones, but it is not. Society is addicted to smartphones, and it doesn’t seem like our use of them is slowing down. </p>
<p>Jonathan Haidt demands that the phone-based childhood be ended now. “By a variety of measures and in a variety of countries, the members of Generation Z (born in and after 1996) are suffering from anxiety, depression, self-harm, and related disorders at levels higher than any other generation for which we have data... I think the answer can be stated simply, although the underlying psychology is complex: Those were the years when adolescents in rich countries traded in their flip phones for smartphones and moved much more of their social lives online — particularly onto social-media platforms designed for virality and addiction. Once young people began carrying the entire internet in their pockets, available to them day and night, it altered their daily experiences and developmental pathways across the board. Friendship, dating, sexuality, exercise, sleep, academics, politics, family dynamics, identity — all were affected....” [7].</p>
<p>The introduction of the iPhone and other smartphones has had a direct negative impact on the lives of children. Children are more depressed and anxious than ever. Before smart technology, adolescents spent time playing outside, making friends, and being independent. They faced boredom, but this was a good thing. This boredom led them to develop life skills and led them to find things to do that made them happy. From a more boring life, their creativity was tested.</p>
<p>Now, children are never bored. Children have access to the entirety of the internet (and most of human knowledge) at any time of day. Children are less inclined to make friends or have fun outside because their phones suck them in. In my opinion, the popular apps, like Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter), and Snapchat are meant to be addictive. To the developers of these apps, the more someone is addicted to their app, the more money they will make. The developers of these apps are getting rich at the expense of the mental health of the users. </p>
<p>I have a cousin who is 10 years younger than me. As a child, her parents would reward her for good behavior with her iPad. But then when it was time to put away the iPad, the child would cry, complain, and behave poorly again. The iPad may have been used as a tool to achieve good behavior by my cousin, but it ended up being a crutch and ended up causing additional bad behavior. </p>
<p>The article also notes that the affected pathways of adolescence that were affected by smartphones can be traced further back [7]. In the 1980s, parents began depriving children and adolescents of freedom. They took away unsupervised play and opportunities for risk taking. The article argues that these things promote competence, maturity, and mental health. This change in childhood accelerated in the early 2010s, when smartphones took off [7].</p>
<p>Even though smartphones are an invention of the recent past, in the decades preceding smartphones, children and adolescents generally had less freedom as time went on. This is an interesting finding. </p>
<p>Because of the change in technology, children now have fragmented attention, social withdrawal, loss of wisdom, and loss of meaning. This generation is cut off from older generations [7].</p>
<p>The article makes some suggestions for a solution. It suggests: no smartphones before high school, no social media before 16, phone free schools, and lastly: More independence, free play, and responsibility in the real world [7].</p>
<p>I completely agree with this suggested solution. I received a smartphone when I was nearly 16. This led to me having a strong childhood. I was never very happy during high school, but I have many great memories of my elementary school and middle school years that would not have been the same if I had a smartphone at the time. I feel lucky that I didn’t get an iPhone until later into childhood. </p>
<p>I also feel lucky that social media hadn’t yet taken off when I was an adolescent. I may have received an iPhone at nearly 16, but the remaining two years of my childhood were free of the pains of social media that are present today. I had a Facebook from a young age, but at that point Facebook was much simpler than what it has become. At that point it purely represented a forum, and it was not so addictive. I did not get an Instagram until I was 18, and at that point it wasn’t a major factor in my life. Nowadays many children and adolescents are obsessed with social media sites like Instagram and care a lot about likes and comments. While I had social media as a youth, it was less focused on likes and comments, which can make users insecure. In my opinion, social media like this began getting popular in 2016 and on. At that point I was about 20 years old. Children’s obsession with likes and comments nowadays can cause a dip in mental health. </p>
<p>The article [7] makes a good point that the current generation is cut off from older generations. When I was a child, I was interested in old music, old video games, and old movies. I was into everything considered retro in the 2000s. I had a deep respect for the media of older generations and spent a lot of my free time getting to know older media. I developed a love of retro gaming and classic rock music. If my childhood had been filled to the brim with smartphones, I doubt that I would have developed my interests that I love today. </p>
<h3>Here are some alarming facts about smartphones:</h3>
<p>There are roughly 6.92 billion smartphone users across the world. That’s 86.29 of the global population, as of 2023 [8].</p>
<p>59.16% of website traffic comes from mobile devices, as of 2022 [8].</p>
<p>17% of Americans still use feature phones, or flip phones. This is skewed toward particular demographics, with 25% of those making less than $30,000 a year owning a feature phone and 40% of those aged 65 and older owning one [8].</p>
<p>The average American touches their phone 2,617 times per day. For heavy users, that number can reach over 5,000 [8].</p>
<p>The average American will check their phone once every ten to 12 minutes [8].</p>
<p>The average American spends 5 hours and 24 minutes on their mobile device each day [8].</p>
<p>One takeaway from these statistics is that most people always have an incredibly addictive piece of technology in their pocket.</p>
<p>Another takeaway is that cell phones went from a way to easily call or text people to the primary means of accessing the internet in the world. </p>

<h3>With these statistics, it sure seems like we’re addicted, huh?</h3>

<h1>There are some positives to smartphones.</h1>
<p>Smartphones grant access to email, video calling, video conferencing, and photo sharing. Before smartphones, this could never be done on your phone [9]. This can be very useful. For example, during one of the first lectures of CSC543 this semester, I lost my internet connection. I was able to load up Microsoft Teams on my iPhone, enter the meeting, and missed barely any of the lecture. </p>
<p>Instagram, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, and Snapchat will keep you connected to your peers. </p>
<p>Another positive of smartphones is that they are extremely small and portable. In yesteryear you would need to carry a bunch of different technologies around to do the same thing you can do now. “In the past you might have needed a backpack to carry around all the devices needed for daily business activities. You would need your pager, cell phone and your PDA. You also need an MP3 player, an e-book reader, a camera and a GPS device for you to go through your life properly. Not even mentioning the desk calendar and This is where the advantages of smartphone come into the frame. Through miniaturized hardware that packs a processor, speakers, a camera, a GPS receiver, a Wi-Fi adapter and a high definition touch-sensitive screen, you can now easily embrace all of the functionalities in just a soap-shaped size that can fit into your pocket” [9]. The iPhone gives you so many technological possibilities at the palm of your hand. This is definitely a positive. If someone living in the 1990s saw smartphones, they would think of them as amazing. </p>
<p>Another positive of smartphones is that you will never be bored. You have endless entertainment at the tips of your fingers. </p>
<p>Another personal positive of smartphones is the ease of getting into concerts. In the past, I have lost or misplaced paper concert tickets close to the time of the concert. This caused a dilemma. Nowadays, most concert tickets are mobile tickets. This mostly prevents the possibility of losing the ticket, as most people would not lose their phone. </p>
<h1>The world would be better off without them.</h1>
<p>While smartphones bring many positives to society, they have had an overall negative impact on society. </p>
<p>Smartphones can give you access to email, video calling, video conferencing, and photo sharing. It is very useful to be able to do these things basically anywhere. Having these things at your fingertips can lead you to be too used to them being at your disposal. Many jobs require the use of email, video calling, and video conferencing. In my opinion, having these at your quick disposal may lead you to think more about work during your time off. You could get sucked into work when you’re not actively working. Before smartphones were invented, this was not a problem. Workers would leave their obligations at work. Now, workers may feel the effects of work when they are at home. </p>
<p>Smartphones cause distraction. A smartphone having so many options may decrease the productivity of a user. They may get distracted by the infinite possibilities on a smartphone, rather than doing their work. The ability of a smartphone also can cause addiction. </p>
<p>There are endless apps and games that can be used to keep you entertained. We are better off without this. Being bored is what led people to find fun in their free time in yesteryear. The boredom of life led them to seek thrills and good times when they did have free time. Nowadays, children do not feel the need to have thrills and fun times, as they can seemingly endlessly scroll on their phones. Because phones are so entertaining and easy to use, children are developing fewer real friendships and are having less authentic fun. </p>
<p>Overall, iPhones have been a detriment to society. Not only are they distracting when work needs to be done, but they can cause mental health problems in their users. As mentioned above, the sooner a person gets a smartphone in their life, the worse their mental health is. Daily experiences and developmental pathways have been greatly altered and erased by smartphones. Children’s social lives are now more and more online than in person.  </p>
<p>Children are more anxious and depressed than before. The social media apps cause a decrease in mental health and are designed to be addictive. Children are obsessed with likes and feel insecure due to social media. However, because of how addictive these apps are, the children can't stop. </p>
<p>Because of this change in technology, children now have fragmented attention, social withdrawal, loss of wisdom, and loss of meaning. This generation is cut off from older generations. The popularity of smartphones seems to increase exponentially all the time. The average American spends hours on their mobile device every day.</p>
<h3> In conclusion, smartphones have had a negative impact on society. We would be better off without them, but there is no going back now.</h3>
